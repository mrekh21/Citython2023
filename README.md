# Citython2023

Our project at Citython 2023 was about continuous monitoring of the number of people getting on and off
the bus by means of laser sensors. The results would be creation of transportation routes that are optimally 
adapted to the needs of the population, making advance predictions about the likely overcrowding in a particular 
bus at a particular time, provision of current information on overcrowding of buses to the population of Kutaisi.
